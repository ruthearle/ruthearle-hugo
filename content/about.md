> “If you want to learn something, read about it. If you want to understand something, write about it. If you want to master something, teach it.” —[Yogi Bhajan][1]

The sole purpose of this blog is for me and anyone who cares to read it to become better programmers.

But why another blog about programming? Why not just study whats out there already and hope that something sticks? Well, firstly, I want to test the truthyness of the axiom uttered by [Yogi Bhajan][1] (and many others), secondly to serve as a repository for things I have learned and deemed important enough to write down and remember, and lastly it is my attempt to try and silence the noise of my unhelpful, negative voice that insists on telling me that I am an Imposter. {{< figure src="/img/profile/cartoonMe.jpg" title="Me">}}

I am sure the last one is a red herring, because as I have learned:

 ```elixir
 growth = new_skill |> discomfort |> uncertainty |> lack_of_confidence |> imposter_syndrome
 ```
